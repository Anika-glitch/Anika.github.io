    <div>Tame Impala is the psychedelic music project of Australian multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker. In the recording studio, Parker writes, records, performs, and produces all of the project's music. As a touring act, Tame Impala consists of Parker (guitar, vocals), Dominic Simper (guitar, synthesiser), Jay Watson (synthesiser, vocals, guitar), Cam Avery (bass guitar, vocals), and Julien Barbagallo (drums, vocals). The group has a close affiliation with fellow Australian psychedelic rock band Pond, sharing members and collaborators, including Nick Allbrook, formerly a live member of Tame Impala. Originally signed to Modular Recordings, Tame Impala is now signed to Interscope Records in the US, and Fiction Records in the UK.</div>
    <div>Parker originally conceived the project in Perth in 2007. After a series of singles and EPs, Tame Impala's debut studio album, Innerspeaker, was released in 2010; it was certified gold in Australia and well received by critics. Parker's 2012 follow-up, Lonerism, was also acclaimed, reaching platinum status in Australia and receiving a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Album. Tame Impala's third album, Currents, was released in July 2015, and like its predecessor, it won ARIA Awards for Best Rock Album and Album of the Year. Parker won the APRA Award for Song of the Year 2016 for Currents' first track, "Let It Happen".The fourth and most recent studio album, The Slow Rush, was released 14 February 2020</div>

<h3>HIS MUSIC- and why I listen</h3>
<div id="music">
    <div class="flex-container-two">

<div> 
    There is something about his music that has this weird calming effect on me. The topics he writes about are the kind of stuff you would think about but not be able to put into the real world. Every song is a work of art because he does everything himself and you can almost see through the beats, unvieling an image of a complex lonely man quite like the rest of us(just supremely talented) being able to spin his loneliness into sounds.</div>
<div>A couple of my favorite songs are "let it happen" that seems oddly perfect for those stressful moments where all the noise in the world suddenly starts making itself heard. Another favorite of mine is "Solitude is bliss" particularly good for long walks back home.</div>
<div>"When we were livin' in squalor, wasn't it Heaven?
    Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
    Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
    Eventually, terrible memories turn into great ones"
    - Lyrics from "Lost in Yesterday", Tame Impala</div>
